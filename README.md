# Opportunity Lib V2

### What is this?

OpportunityLib is a project I ([fan87](https://github.com/fan87)) started entirely for fun! I've been optimizing the creation of Git commits for hours, and this repository has fun stuff related to it!

The library I wrote/made for this purpose is called "GitBuster", which is capable of creating millions of commits in just a few minutes.
